# Specification

Scopie is designed as a set of logic rules such that it is
possible to evaluate whether or not an action is allowed to take place.

A full list of specifications with inputs and outputs are available 
as a [JSON file](https://github.com/miniscruff/scopie/blob/main/scenarios.json)
that implementations should use in there test suite.
This file also includes specific tests for benchmarking performance.
